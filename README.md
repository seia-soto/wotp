# Configuration

To host wOTP server, you need to prepare environment which can run Node.JS and MariaDB(, or compatible DBMS).
After cloning or downloading this repository, copy `src/config.example.js` to `src/config.js` and start editing it.

- `app.port`: port to host wOTP server.
- `app.secret`: secret value to encrypt tokens.
- `database.client`: DBMS to use, only MariaDB compatible DBMS are mainline. However, you can use other DBMS which Knex.JS supports.
- `database.connection.host`: DBMS host.
- `database.connection.user`: DBMS user.
- `database.connection.password`: DBMS password.
- `database.connection.database` DBMS database name to use.

## Advanced

### Using another DBMS rather than MariaDB compatible

To use another DBMS instead of MariaDB compatible system, you need to install the dependency first and do test if server is working properly. We do not support DBMS except for mysql.

### Clustering

We recommend you to cluster this application via PM2 to increase handling performance by distributing the load.

- For example, running 4 processes.

```sh
pm2 start src/index.js -i 4
```

For more information, please refer [PM2 documentation](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/cluster-mode/).

# Development

There are some recommended and required stacks to develop wOTP server.
Before we start, ensure that we have following dependencies installed on your system.

- Git
- Node.JS latest LTS release
- Yarnpkg
- Native module compiler
- MariaDB or compatible DBMS system
- Editor supporting PnP modules with ESlint v7

Then clone this repository and run following commands:

```sh
yarn
yarn prepare # this will install husky hooks (pre-commit)
```

Now, you can configure the project by copying `src/config.example.js` to `src/config.js`.

## Scripts

There are some scripts available for ease of development.

### `yarn start`

Starts the wOTP server with environment vars including deploying database.

- DEBUG=wotp*

### `yarn debug`

Starts the wOTP server with environment vars including deploying database.

- DEBUG=*

### `yarn app:start`

Starts the wOTP server with environment vars.

- DEBUG=wotp*

### `yarn app:debug`

Starts the wOTP server with environment vars.

- DEBUG=*

### `yarn deploy`

Deploys database.

**To delete all required tables before creating one, attach `-c` at the end.**

### `yarn lint`

Checks whether the code will fit in Standard.JS rules by ESlint.

**You should pass this test to contribute.**

### `yarn release`

Maintains project pipeline by standard-version.

**Will not maintained in forked state! Please never touch.**

```sh
yarn release --major
yarn release --minor
yarn release --patch
```

### `yarn prepare`

Prepares husky hook on your system.
Please check out PATHs of Node.JS if this not working.

### `yarn test`

Runs test.
